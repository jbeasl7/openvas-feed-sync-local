  script_tag(name:"insight", value:"A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in libtiff 4.6.0. This vulnerability affects the function PS_Lvl2page of the file tools/tiff2ps.c of the component tiff2ps. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is possible to launch the attack on the local host. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The name of the patch is 6ba36f159fd396ad11bf6b7874554197736ecc8b. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. One of the maintainers explains, that '[t]his error only occurs if DEFER_STRILE_LOAD (defer-strile-load:BOOL=ON) or TIFFOpen( .. 'rD') option is used.'(CVE-2025-8534)

A vulnerability was found in LibTIFF up to 4.7.0. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function t2p_read_tiff_init of the file tools/tiff2pdf.c of the component fax2ps. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. The attack needs to be approached locally. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The patch is named 2ebfffb0e8836bfb1cd7d85c059cd285c59761a4. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2024-13978)

A vulnerability was determined in LibTIFF up to 4.5.1. Affected by this issue is the function readSeparateStripsetoBuffer of the file tools/tiffcrop.c of the component tiffcrop. The manipulation leads to stack-based buffer overflow. Local access is required to approach this attack. The patch is identified as 8a7a48d7a645992ca83062b3a1873c951661e2b3. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.(CVE-2025-8851)

A vulnerability was found in LibTIFF up to 4.7.0. It has been rated as critical. This issue affects the function setrow of the file tools/thumbnail.c. The manipulation leads to buffer overflow. An attack has to be approached locally. The patch is named e8c9d6c616b19438695fd829e58ae4fde5bfbc22. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.(CVE-2025-8177)

A flaw has been found in LibTIFF 4.7.0. This affects the function _TIFFmallocExt/_TIFFCheckRealloc/TIFFHashSetNew/InitCCITTFax3 of the file tools/tiffcmp.c of the component tiffcmp. Executing manipulation can lead to memory leak. The attack is restricted to local execution. This attack is characterized by high complexity. It is indicated that the exploitability is difficult. The exploit has been published and may be used. There is ongoing doubt regarding the real existence of this vulnerability. This patch is called ed141286a37f6e5ddafb5069347ff5d587e7a4e0. It is best practice to apply a patch to resolve this issue. A researcher disputes the security impact of this issue, because 'this is a memory leak on a command line tool that is about to exit anyway'. In the reply the project maintainer ...
