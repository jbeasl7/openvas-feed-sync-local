Groffer is a\n script to display formatted output on the console or X, and is not normally\n used in other scripts (for printers, etc) like most groff components are.\n The risk from this bug is probably quite low. The fix was pulled from the\n just-released groff-1.19.2. With Slackware 10.2 just around the corner it\n didn't seem prudent to upgrade to that -- the diff from 1.19.1 to 1.19.2\n is over a megabyte compressed.\n For more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n\nkde/kdebase-3.4.2-i486-2.tgz: Patched a bug in Konqueror's handling of\n characters such as '*', '[', and '?'.\n Generated new kdm config files.\n Added /opt/kde/man to $MANPATH.\n Patched a security bug in kcheckpass that could allow a local user to\n gain root privileges.\n For more information, see:\n [links moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n\nn/mod_ssl-2.8.24_1.3.33-i486-1.tgz: Upgraded to mod_ssl-2.8.24-1.3.33.\n From the CHANGES file:\n Fix a security issue (CAN-2005-2700) where 'SSLVerifyClient require' was\n not enforced in per-location context if 'SSLVerifyClient optional' was\n configured in the global virtual host configuration.\n For more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n\nn/openssh-4.2p1-i486-1.tgz: Upgraded to openssh-4.2p1.\n From the OpenSSH 4.2 release announcement:\n SECURITY: Fix a bug introduced in OpenSSH 4.0 that caused\n GatewayPorts to be incorrectly activated for dynamic ('-D') port\n forwardings when no listen address was explicitly specified.\n (* Security fix *)\n\nkde/kdeedu-3.4.2-i486-2.tgz: Fixed a minor /tmp bug in kvoctrain.\n (* Security fix *)\n\nn/php-4.4.0-i486-3.tgz: Relinked with the system PCRE library, as the builtin\n library has a buffer overflow that could be triggered by the processing of a\n specially crafted regular expression.\n For more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n Upgraded PEAR::XMLRPC to version 1.4.0, which eliminates the use of the\n insecure eval() function.\n For ...

To partly revert to the old behaviour\n the new option --allow-multisig-verification may be used.\n Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.2.1 (2006-02-14)\n * Security fix for a verification weakness in gpgv. Some input\n could lead to gpgv exiting with 0 even if the detached signature\n file did not carry any signature. This is not as fatal as it\n might seem because the suggestion as always been not to rely on\n th exit code but to parse the --status-fd messages. However it\n is likely that gpgv is used in that simplified way and thus we\n do this release. Same problem with 'gpg --verify' but nobody\n should have used this for signature verification without\n checking the status codes anyway.

Now, after the $JAVA_HOME\n variable is set, the next variable settings make use of it, rather\n than hard-coding the path to $JAVA_HOME. This does not fix a bug,\n but is certainly better scripting style. Thanks to Jason Byrne and\n Jean-Christophe Fargette for suggesting this change.\n+--------------------------+",

First, use of xdg-open in\n /etc/mailcap was found to be unsafe -- xdg-open passes along downloaded files\n without indicating what mime type they initially presented themselves as,\n leaving programs further down the processing chain to discover the file type\n again. This makes it rather trivial to present a script (such as a .desktop\n file) as a document type (like a PDF) so that it looks safe to click on in a\n browser, but will result in the execution of an arbitrary script. It might\n be safe to send files to trusted applications in /etc/mailcap, but it does\n not seem to be safe to send files to xdg-open in /etc/mailcap.\n This package will comment out calls to xdg-open in /etc/mailcap if they are\n determined to have been added by a previous version of this package.\n If you've made any local customizations to /etc/mailcap, be sure to check\n that there are no uncommented calls to xdg-open after installing this update.\n Thanks to Manuel Reimer for discovering this issue.\n For more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n Another bug in xdg-open fails to sanitize input properly allowing the\n execution of arbitrary commands. This was fixed in the xdg-utils repository\n quite some time ago (prior to the inclusion of xdg-utils in Slackware), but\n was never fixed in the official release of xdg-utils.

A kernel bug discovered by Tavis Ormandy\nand Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team could allow a local user\nto fill memory page zero with arbitrary code and then use the kernel\nsendpage operation to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, executing the\ncode in the context of the kernel. If successfully exploited, this bug\ncan be used to gain root access.\n\nAt this time we have prepared fixed kernels for the stable version of\nSlackware (12.2), as well as for both 32-bit x86 and x86_64 -current\nversions. Additionally, we have added a package to the /patches\ndirectory for Slackware 12.1 and 12.2 that will set the minimum memory\npage that can be mmap()ed from userspace without additional privileges\nto 4096. The package will work with any kernel supporting the\nvm.mmap_min_addr tunable, and should significantly reduce the potential\nharm from this bug, as well as future similar bugs that might be found\nin the kernel. More updated kernels may follow.\n\nFor more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n\n\nHere are the details from the Slackware 12.2 ChangeLog:\n+--------------------------+\npatches/packages/linux-2.6.27.31/:\n Added new kernels and kernel packages for Linux 2.6.27.31 to address\n a bug in proto_ops structures which could allow a user to use the\n kernel sendpage operation to execute arbitrary code in page zero.\n This could allow local users to gain escalated privileges.\n This flaw was discovered by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the\n Google Security Team.\n For more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n In addition, these kernels change CONFIG_DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR kernel\n config option value to 4096, which should prevent the execution of\n arbitrary code by future NULL dereference bugs that might be found in\n the kernel. If you are compiling your own kernel, please check this\n option in your .config. If it is set to =0, you may wish to edit it\n to 4096 (or some other value > 0) and then reconfigure, or the kernel\n will not have default protection against zero page attacks from\n userspace.\n (* Security fix *)\npatches/packages/kernel-mmap_min_addr-4096-noarch-1.tgz:\n This package adds an init script to edit /etc/sysctl.conf, adding\n this config option:\n vm.mmap_min_addr = 4096\n This will configure the kernel to disallow mmap() to userspace of any\n page lower than 4096, preventing privilege escalation by CVE-2009-2692.\n This is a hot fix package and will take effect immediately upon\n installation on any system running a kernel that supports configurable\n /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr (kernel 2.6.23 or newer).\n (* Security fix *)\n+--------------------------+",

Due to the bug, Emacs\n instead automatically evaluates such `eval' forms. Thus, if the user\n changes the value of `enable-local-variables' to `:safe', visiting a\n malicious file can cause automatic execution of arbitrary Emacs Lisp\n code with the permissions of the user.

By sending a large number of invalid session\n tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service\n attack.\n SSL 3.0 Fallback protection:\n OpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications\n to block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol\n downgrade.\n Some client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a\n downgraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older\n servers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to\n downgrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection\n support higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses\n including POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).\n Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568):\n When OpenSSL is configured with 'no-ssl3' as a build option, servers\n could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be\n configured to send them.\n For more information, see:\n [links moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n+--------------------------+",

As of version\n 7.0, OpenSSH has deprecated some older (and presumably less secure)\n algorithms, and also (by default) only allows root login by public-key,\n hostbased and GSSAPI authentication. Make sure that your keys and\n authentication method will allow you to continue accessing your system\n after the upgrade.\n The release notes for OpenSSH 7.0 list the following incompatible changes\n to be aware of:\n * Support for the legacy SSH version 1 protocol is disabled by\n default at compile time.\n * Support for the 1024-bit diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 key exchange\n is disabled by default at run-time. It may be re-enabled using\n the instructions at [link moved to references]\n * Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-* host and user keys is disabled\n by default at run-time. These may be re-enabled using the\n instructions at [link moved to references]\n * Support for the legacy v00 cert format has been removed.\n * The default for the sshd_config(5) PermitRootLogin option has\n changed from 'yes' to 'prohibit-password'.\n * PermitRootLogin=without-password/prohibit-password now bans all\n interactive authentication methods, allowing only public-key,\n hostbased and GSSAPI authentication (previously it permitted\n keyboard-interactive and password-less authentication if those\n were enabled).\n (* Security fix *)\n+--------------------------+",

(CVE-2017-16612)\n It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow\n while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.\n The integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for\n dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes\n 4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will\n lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n The signedness bug is triggered by reading the length of a comment\n as unsigned int, but casting it to int when calling the function\n XcursorCommentCreate. Turning length into a negative value allows the\n check against XCURSOR_COMMENT_MAX_LEN to pass, and the following\n addition of sizeof (XcursorComment) + 1 makes it possible to allocate\n less memory than needed for subsequent reads.\n For more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n+--------------------------+",

As the LXC project considers privileged containers to be unsafe\n no CVE has been assigned for this issue for LXC. To prevent this attack,\n LXC has been patched to create a temporary copy of the calling binary\n itself when it starts or attaches to containers. To do this LXC creates an\n anonymous, in-memory file using the memfd_create() system call and copies\n itself into the temporary in-memory file, which is then sealed to prevent\n further modifications. LXC then executes this sealed, in-memory file\n instead of the original on-disk binary.\n For more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n+--------------------------+",

To address this, the ownership checks introduced in v2.30.3\n are now extended to cover cloning local repositories.\n Local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's\n object database when source and target repository reside on the same\n disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then\n those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the\n untrusted user.\n When cloning a local source repository that contains symlinks via the\n filesystem, Git may create hardlinks to arbitrary user-readable files\n on the same filesystem as the target repository in the objects/\n directory.\n It is supposed to be safe to clone untrusted repositories, even those\n unpacked from zip archives or tarballs originating from untrusted\n sources, but Git can be tricked to run arbitrary code as part of the\n clone.\n For more information, see:\n [links moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n+--------------------------+",

Add optional strict parameter to\n these two functions: use strict=False to get the old behavior, accept\n malformed inputs. getattr(email.utils, 'supports_strict_parsing', False) can\n be used to check if the strict paramater is available.\n Sanitize names in zipfile.Path to avoid infinite loops (gh-122905) without\n breaking contents using legitimate characters.\n Email headers with embedded newlines are now quoted on output. The generator\n will now refuse to serialize (write) headers that are unsafely folded or\n delimited, see verify_generated_headers.\n For more information, see:\n [links moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n+--------------------------+",

The\n vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then\n adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a\n heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds\n relative to this buffer.

This could be\n abused to execute code the user didn't expect. e.g., given a certain prompt\n configuration, an attacker could trick a user into executing arbitrary code\n by having them check out a Git branch with a specially crafted name.\n This is fixed in the shell itself by no longer performing PROMPT_SUBST\n evaluation on these prompt-expansion arguments.\n Note that this is a potential incompatibilty if you are relying\n on the previous behavior of PROMPT_SUBST.\n Thanks to pblsxw for the heads-up on this.\n For more information, see:\n [link moved to references]\n (* Security fix *)\n+--------------------------+",
